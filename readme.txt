The file Final_version.ipynb is the Python file that should be runned in Jupyter Notebook. This file is supposed to be in the main folder.
The dataset is supposed to be in the main folder in a folder called 'fruits-360'. In this folder there is supposed to be 4 subfolders, namely 'paper', 'test-multiple_fruits', 'Training' and 'Validation' (only the last two are used). If this is correct then running the program should work as expected.
